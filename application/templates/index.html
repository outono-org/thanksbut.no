<h3>Thanks But No.</h3>
<main>
    <h1>It's time to improve the way we learn, work and live.</h1>
    <section>
        <p>Today’s world is truly amazing. During the last century life expectancy has gone from 32 to 72 years old, the percentage of the population living under extreme poverty went from nearly 70% down to 10% and literacy increased from only 20% up to 86%. However, we still have a lot to improve.</p>
        <p>
            Yes, we are extremely grateful for the achievements of our ancestors, but gratitude does not imply passivity or accepting things as they are. Taking things for granted might lead us to forget that our existence is defined but its impermanence. We aren’t playing a single game, but rather an infinite set of constantly changing games. 
        </p>
        <p>
            TBN is a community for people who embrace change and want to keep on building the games that dictate our way of living.
